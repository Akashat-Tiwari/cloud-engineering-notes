## Process :

* One or more related tasks (threads) executing on the computer, not a command or program : a single command can start multiple processes simultaneously

* ps : used to display current running processes

* ps -ef : used to display all the processes in the system in full detail

* pstree : display process in a tree diagram form (relationship b/w process and its parent processes)

PiD : unique Process ID number

TiD : Thread ID number, same as Pid if process is single-threaded. For multi threaded processes , each thread shares the same Pid but has a unique Tid

### Priority of Processes and manipulating the priority :

* To see the priority of the processes use : ps lf 

* priority can be Seen by niceness of a process or priority can be set by niceness : NI , lower the niceness -> higher the priority

* to change the niceness (NI) of a process use : renice +x PID , x = increment in old NI to get the new NI

* you can increase NI but can only decrease the NI by super user or Rootuser ie use sudo before

### foreground Job : a job that runs directly from the shell 

### background job : will be executed at lower priority which in turn will allow smooth execution

* ctrl + c : terminates a foreground process

* ctrl + z : suspend a foreground process

* bg and fg : used to run background and foreground process

### The top command :

* used to interactively monitor the processes (better as compared to repeatedly using ps command)

* refresh itself in 2-3 seconds interval (by default)
